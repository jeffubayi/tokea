# Proposal 🔥
This project is a study of the iFood interface.
The idea is to simulate a food delivery application, bringing data from a fake API and integrate the information available on screen, such as the restaurants available to the customer. The difference of this project is the responsive mode built for all mobile devices and the pages built using Server Side Rendering (SSR).
