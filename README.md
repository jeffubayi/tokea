The idea is to simulate an events booking application, bringing data from a fake API and integrate the information available on screen, such as the concerts available to the customer. The difference of this project is the responsive mode built for all mobile devices and the pages built using Server Side Rendering (SSR).

To obtain this project, follow the steps:
1. Clone this repository using <code> git clone </code>.
2. Run the <code> yarn </code> command at the root of the cloned project folder to download the dependencies.
3. Run <code> npx json-server server.json -p 3333 </code> at the root of the project folder to initialize the Fake API. <br/>
(if you want, you can use the public api url managed by My JSON Server, which comes by default in the api.ts file)
4. Run <code> yarn dev </code> at the root of the project folder to start the application in development mode.
5. Open the application in your emulator. ðŸš€
