# Tokea
Discover great events and buy tickets or Host your own events.


### Proposal 
This project is a study of the tokea interface.
The idea is to simulate an events booking application, bringing data from a fake API and integrate the information available on screen, such as the concerts available to the customer. The difference of this project is the responsive mode built for all mobile devices and the pages built using Server Side Rendering (SSR).
